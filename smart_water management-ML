Smart Water Management System is a cutting-edge solution that utilizes AI algorithms to optimize water usage in cities. By analyzing data from IoT sensors embedded in water meters and pipes, this system can efficiently manage water resources and promote sustainable water practices.

The integration of AI algorithms allows the system to monitor and analyze real-time data on water consumption, flow rates, and leakage detection. By harnessing this information, it can identify patterns, anomalies, and areas of inefficiency in the water distribution network. This enables proactive measures to be taken, such as detecting and fixing leaks promptly, reducing water wastage, and ensuring a more efficient water supply.

The IoT sensors play a crucial role in collecting data at various points in the water distribution system, providing valuable insights into consumption patterns and infrastructure conditions. These sensors track water usage at individual households, commercial buildings, and public spaces, allowing for detailed analysis and optimization.

AI algorithms then analyze this data to identify areas where water usage can be optimized. By considering factors such as weather
